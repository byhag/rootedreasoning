A prophecy is a prediction about the future that has divine origins. There are five conceivable reasons for how a so-called “prophecy” could potentially be fulfilled. First, it could be fulfilled because of sheer luck. Second, it could be that the prophecy was actually made after the prophecy was “fulfilled”. Third, it could be that interpreters twisted the words of the prophecy so that they meet the fulfillment. Fourth, it could be that someone knew about the prophecy and helped to aid the fulfilling of the prophecy. Finally, it could be that the prophecy is from God. Only one of the five possibilities fulfills the necessary requirements to be truly prophetic.
 
Conceivably, if a so-called “prophecy” is not due to one of the first four reasons, then it must be the fifth reason, from God. So, if a prophecy is not just a lucky guess, was made sufficiently before its fulfillment, was not twisted by its interpreters, and was not self-fulfilled, then it is from God. If the Bible is proven to be a prophetic book, then it is a book from God.
 
This page is devoted to prophecies that were made and fulfilled before the time of Jesus. Because the Old Testament is filled with prophetic statements (far too many to discuss here), a few were chosen that appeared to best meet the above criteria.
 
## Cyrus Prophecy
In Isaiah 45:1, it reads “Thus says the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue nations before him and to loose the belts of kings, to open doors before him that gates may not be closed:”. Isaiah 44:28 says, “who says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose’; saying of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be built,’ and of the temple, ‘Your foundation shall be laid.’”
 
The book of Isaiah the prophet is dated approximately between 701 and 681 BC before Jerusalem was conquered and captives were taken by the Babylonian empire. The Cyrus we read about is clearly Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Achaemenid Empire, or Persian Empire [[1]]({{page.permalink}}/#References). He defeated conquered Babylon in 539 BC, built an empire larger the world had yet seen, and was very benevolent to the nations he conquered. The Cyrus Cylinder confirms that he allowed the many native peoples, like the Jews, to return to their homelands with their ancient relics [[2]]({{page.permalink}}/#References). Yet, 150 years before his conquering of Babylon, he is called by name in the Bible.
 
## Edom Vengeance Prophecy
In Ezekiel 25:14, it says, “I will take vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they will deal with Edom in accordance with my anger and my wrath; they will know my vengeance, declares the Sovereign LORD.'" According to the Columbia Encyclopedia, Fifth Edition: "Edomite history was marked by continuous hostility and warfare with Jews… At the end of the second century B.C., they were subdued by Hasmonaean priest-king John Hyrcanus I..."
 
Ezekiel wrote this prophecy and several like it around 593-571 BC. During this time the Jews were exiles in Babylon after the destruction of Jerusalem. Such a prophecy is especially meaningful when we consider that for the fulfillment of the prophecy must include Israel being rebuilt before any conquering could take place. To a Jew who witnessed the destruction of the temple and walls of Jerusalem, and the killing of thousands of Jews, the fulfillment of the prophecy would seem like very improbable. However, about 400 years later, it happened.
 
## Babylonian Rule Prophecy
In Jeremiah 25:9-12, written around 600 BC, it says, “I will summon all the peoples of the north and my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon," declares the LORD, "and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants and against all the surrounding nations. I will completely destroy them and make them an object of horror and scorn, and an everlasting ruin. I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, the sound of millstones and the light of the lamp. This whole country will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years. But when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation, the land of the Babylonians, for their guilt," declares the LORD, "and will make it desolate forever.” We can read from history that the Babylonian Empire took power from the Assyrian empire in Battle of Harran in 609 BC. Exactly 70 years later, 539 BC, Cyrus, leader of the Medo-Persians, conquered the Babylonian empire [[3]]({{page.permalink}}/#References). As we have discussed earlier, the nation of Judah was captured and exile, and one of the first great acts of Cyrus’s rule was to allow the Jews to return to their homeland.
 
How could the book of Jeremiah say with such accuracy that the Babylonian rule would last 70 years? Jeremiah was written clearly before the desolation of Jerusalem, near the beginning of the Babylonian rule. It couldn’t be a mere coincidence that he guessed Babylonian rule would end after precisely 70 years. No one doubted that he was meaning a literal 70 years, because the 70 years is written about in three other places ( Zechariah 7:12,    2 Chronicles 36:21, and Daniel 9:2). Also, it is obvious that the Jews had nothing to do with end of the Babylonians; they were simply slaves in its vast empire.
 
## Conclusion
What would we make of these prophecies? We can prove conclusively that man could not bring about the fulfillment of these prophecies. Can man foretell the precise name of a future usurper of the throne of the reigning empire? Can man foretell that slaves in an empire would regain their power and overthrow a nation that had opposed them? Can man foretell that an empire that ruled much of the known world will last precisely 70 years?
 
No, it is only a supernatural being that can foretell such things. It is God who holds the breadth of time in his hand. It is He who wrote these words, and, by His same hand, we have the rest of the Scriptures.
