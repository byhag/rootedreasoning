In the previous article, we talked about the idea of sin. What is the big deal? In discussing the consequences of sin, we will also answer the ever important question of what happens after death. Fortunately, God provides us very straightforward answers to these questions.
​ 

## Separation and Death
The Bible has made it very clear the consequences of sin. “Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows” (Galatians 6:7). The next verse then describes those who indulge in sinful behavior: “The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction” (Galatians 6:8). Though sin may promise great things, it only gives shame and death. If we take an honest look at our lives and history, we can see this. When will we see that our way (sin) is only leading to death (Romans 6:21)?
 
Remember that God is holy and desires us, as His creation, to be holy (1 Peter 1:16). However, we rebelled against Him, and in His holiness and justness, He cannot be in our presence (Habakkuk 1:13). Not only does are sin bring our shame and death, more importantly, we are separated from the One who gives us purity and life. (Isaiah 59:2)
 
## Hell
God knows all of our wrongs, and we must give account to God for each one of them (Hebrews 4:13). Our inevitable final accounting before God occurs following our deaths (Hebrews 9:27) where God will examine our hearts and our deeds (Matthew 12:36; Revelation 20:11-15; 1 Corinthians 4:5). Only two options await us at this pivotal moment: heaven and hell (Matthew 25:31-46).
 
Hell is described as a real place, a place with eternal fire and decay (Mark 9:43-48). But more than a place of suffering, it is place away from the presence and glory of God (2 Thessalonians 1:9).
 
If we doubt this judgment, then we either doubt God’s written words or the justness of God. God has written to us concerning these things in very simple terms - do we doubt them? Or do we doubt that God is just? Do we ask, how could a loving God condemn me to such torment? Instead of doubting God, we should remember that God never wanted us to perish and has been patient with us (2 Peter 3:9), but He, because of His nature, gave us a choice - Him or ourselves - and gave us up to our desire (Romans 1:28-31).
 
We chose our path with its destination. We put the distance between us and our God, not Him.
 
## Heaven
Heaven, on the other hand, is described as a place where there is no death, no pain, and no crying (Revelation 21:4). It is a place that God has prepared for us (John 14:2) that is far more glorious that what we could imagine (1 Corinthians 2:9). More importantly, however, we will be in the presence of God (Revelation 21:22-27). There is no need of light, because the glory of God provides the light. There is no need for death, because the glory of God provides life. There is no need for crying, because the glory of God provides eternal joy (Revelation 21:22-27).
 
Everything that we could call good on earth is from God, (James 1:27). All of the good we can see and all the good things we enjoy are just a reflection of the goodness of God. Heaven, then, is taking off the mask of this life and seeing Good for what He really is. Enough Good, to praise and enjoy for eternity.
 
## Conclusion
In the final judgment, our sinful lives don’t stand a chance to the purity of God and His divine moral law. We need help. More than that, we need a Savior. As talked about in the next group of lessons, this Savior has come! He preaches life and hope and not death or sorrow       (John 3:16-17)!
