Francis Crick, who together with James Watson discovered the structure of DNA in 1953, wrote a book in 1994 called, The Astonishing Hypothesis: The Scientific Search for the Soul. In it, he argues, “You, your joys and your sorrows, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules.” We know intuitively that there’s got to be more to life than that! One Biblical book – Ecclesiastes – zeroes in on this issue.
 
The answer to why we exist in Ecclesiastes is found more through firsthand experience than a burst of special revelation. We are privileged to go on the Grand Search through the eyes of one who had the wherewithal that eludes most of us as he “discovers” life’s purpose. Consequently, Ecclesiastes is the most inductively reasoned book in the Bible. In it, wisdom comes largely through observation. God is permitting Solomon, and, through him, us as well, to see from an experiential standpoint that the historic pursuits of mankind are nothing but dead-end streets, or a “negative preparation” for something infinitely greater.
 
## The Cyclical Nature of Life 

#### (read Ecclesiastes 1:1-11)
First, Solomon asks the million dollar question in v. 3 – essentially, why are we here?  Then he states the never-ending cycles of generations coming and going (v. 4), illustrated by three natural phenomena: a) sunrise and sunset, 1:5; b) the circular courses of the wind, 1:6; and c) the evaporation cycle, 1:7. Life is like an endless race track, but are we really getting anywhere? The concept of a never-ending cycle is more fully developed in 3:1-11, which prompted the lyrics (some of us will remember), “There is a season… turn, turn, turn…”
 
The bottom line is that generations come and go, but life goes on. Innovation changes the life experience slightly, but the major issues of life remain fixed – even monotonous. “What has been is what will be… and there is nothing new under the sun” (1:9). And even with the passing of time, it’s business as usual – or, as we say, “Been there, done that!” Moreover, “there is no remembrance of former things… among those who come after” (1:11). I sometimes ask people, “Do you know the names of your great-great-great grandparents?” Genealogy buffs aside, no one does!  If that’s the case, then what are the chances our great-great-great grandchildren will have any memory of us?  And if we’re just “spinning our wheels” here on earth, only to be forgotten by posterity, then why are we here?  
 
## The Emptiness of Worldly Preoccupations 

#### (read Ecclesiastes 2:1-11)
With the drive of a type-A personality, the author tries to break the endless cycle by embarking on a grand Search for Happiness. He has it all: fame, power, money and women (cf. I Kings 4:21-34; 10:1,7; 11:3). Unfortunately, his frame of reference is rather selfish (notice how often “for myself” is repeated in Eccl. 2:4-8).
 
Have you ever heard someone say, “If I only had ____________, then I’d be happy”? (fill in the blank). Here was a man with “everything” his eyes desired! Was he happy? NO! He was miserable. None of these pursuits brought lasting fulfillment. Everything is “vanity” and “striving after wind” (2:11).
 
## The Inescapable Conclusion 

#### (read Ecclesiastes 12:1-14)
This section underscores the brevity of life and the aging process.  “Childhood and the prime of life are fleeting” (11:10). Therefore, the time to “remember your Creator” is when you’re still young, when you still have energy and your whole life ahead of you, ideally (12:1). We’re all getting older, and the grave awaits (12:1-8). I suggest getting a good commentary for suggestions on metaphors of the aging process here, but the overall picture is easy enough to see. The ravages of the old age spare no one (eventually), and death approaches all too fast.  
The compelling conclusion is that this life is a probationary period for a day of reckoning, beyond which we will be rewarded or punished: “The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil” (Eccl. 12:13-14).
 
Toward the end of his life, the famous scientist Carl Sagan wrote a book, Pale Blue Dot. Beginning on the first page, he alludes to a Voyager spacecraft that was projected billions of miles into space. In the photographic images sent back to earth, our planet appears to be nothing more than a “pale blue dot” – hence the title of the book. Mr. Sagan argues that we think that what we’re accomplishing here is important, but it’s really not. We’re nothing but ant-like creatures on a “pale blue dot” in a vast universe so big that it staggers the imagination. Moreover, he argues that there is no one out there to save us from ourselves.
 
If you take God and Judgment Day out of the equation, he’s absolutely right. However, if God and Judgment Day really exist, he’s dead wrong! If life on earth is a probationary period, then everything we do counts, and we’re playing for keeps. Our lives in the latter case are of tremendous worth and value, and eternity hangs in the balances. Consequently, we need God and Judgment Day to validate our purpose here on earth. If you take them away, then our lives are not worth very much at all! Our inherent worth and value are inextricably tied to an ultimate day of reckoning with God.
 
Most people haven’t thought much about the preceding point, but it forces us all to think about life’s ultimate purpose. The bottom line is that not only do we need God, he has not left us without direction and purpose: “fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.”  The God who grants you life and breath has invested your life with infinite purpose and meaning, and He cares enough about us to reveal a blueprint for living.
 
In all of this, we have failed miserably. We have scoffed at God, lived life as we pleased, and filled our lives with depravity. We need a Savior and a fresh start. Enter Jesus into the equation. He offers us a New Covenant – an opportunity to reboot our lives and to realize our purpose at last: to genuinely “fear God and keep his commandments,” with all the right motivation and appreciation for what God has done for us. Whether or not we take advantage of this opportunity is of vital importance.
