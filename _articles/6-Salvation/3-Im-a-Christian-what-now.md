Now that you are a Christian, you may be wondering, “Where do I begin in my service to God?” or “What do I do now that I am a Christian?” No matter how young or old physically when you obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, you are a “babe in Christ” spiritually.  As a newborn spiritually, you must do as I Peter 2:2 says, “As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby:”  Here are some things to consider as you enter this wonderful new life studying God’s word and applying it to your life.
 
## Rejoice
It is time for great rejoicing (Acts 8:39)!  Your relationship with God has changed as you have obeyed the gospel, and He no longer holds you accountable for your past sins (Hebrews 8:12).  Like all relationships this one requires attention, communication, and hard work to be properly maintained.  God made provision for this relationship by giving His only begotten Son to reconcile you to God (Romans 5:10; 2 Corinthians 5:18; Ephesians 2:4-7), so never take this newfound reconciliation for granted.  It is more precious than anything else.
 
## Learn
We, as Christians, want to know the mind of God so that we may better conform ourselves to His wishes and become what He wants us to be.  Read, study, and meditate on God’s word    (2 Timothy 2:15).  How will you know how to please your new Master if you don’t know what He expects of you?  You won’t!
 
Pursue the attributes that God would have us exemplify that hold rewards for us through the promises of God so that we are fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ and not barren (2 Peter 1:5-11).  Consider yourself a living sacrifice ready to be poured out for whatever God has requested of you (Matthew 10:39; Romans 12:1-2).
 
## Put Away Sin
Put away sinful conduct.  Nothing physically changes about the body and its desires once you become a Christian; you must bring your body and mind into subjection to the will of God (Romans 8:12-15).  Begin to put away the sinful attitudes, speech, and conduct that once defined you prior to becoming a Christian (Colossians 3:5-7; 1 Peter 4:3-6).  This is not an automatic process (1 Corinthians 9:24-27).  You must get rid of these sinful behaviors as fast as you can! (Romans 6:1; Galatians 2:20; Romans 6:5-7)  When you do sin, you must confess your sins to God in prayer, and God is faithful and just for forgive us our sins (1 John 1:9; Acts 8:22). 
​
If you ignore your relationship with God, you may find yourself losing not only your relationship with God, but also your very soul in torment (Hebrews 10:26-27). Start and never stop doing all that may be required of you to keep God’s commands (John 14:15, John 15:10). 
 
## Pray
Prayer is our avenue for speaking with God, and we are commanded to do so.  Do not neglect the great privilege you have to communicate with the Creator in order to praise Him for who He is and make your petitions known to Him (James 5:16-18; 1 Thessalonians 5:17; Colossians 4:2).  God wants to hear from you (1 Timothy 2:1-3).
 
## Do Good
As you crucify the desires of the flesh, immediately begin putting on good works (Galatians 5:16; Galatians 6:10).  Begin to practice what you read in the Scripture that God commands of you.  Doing good works is what we were created to do, and you will be amazed at the wonderful sense of purpose and satisfaction that will come through serving our glorious God (Ephesians 2:10).  Everything in your life should be scrutinized in light of God’s word for it is by His word that we will be judged (John 12:48).  Bring into subjection every thought and action to God’s will as revealed in Scripture.  Ask yourself if what you are doing can be described as being part of the fruit of Spirit in Galatians 5:22-23, and meditate on the things listed in Philippians 4:8-9.
 
## Find a Family
Never forget who you belong to (1 Peter 2:9-10), and remember you have a very large family now of brothers and sisters in Christ (1 Timothy 3:15; James 5:16; Matthew 12:50), so do not hesitate to seek encouragement, guidance and prayers from them.  We have examples in the New Testament of brethren joining themselves to a local assembly of Christians so that the work of the church may be carried out in those communities (Acts 9:26-30; Acts 11:25-26).  Make a firm commitment to worship God with your brethren at every opportunity, demonstrating your true heart that has drawn near to God (Hebrews 10:19-25).
 
## Conclusion
Finally, in all that you do, remember to employ fully what our Master Jesus Christ has said are the two greatest commandments.  Everything else we do as Christians seems to fall in place so much easier when we follow these instructions.  Matthew 22:36-40 says “’Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?’  Jesus said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the first and great commandment.  And the second is like it:  ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’  On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.’” I hope this brief article has assisted you in beginning your walk through the narrow gate and difficult way that leads to eternal life (Matthew 7:14).
