The answer to the above question has more of an impact than just one's ideology. One’s answer will directly affect the way he thinks and acts. If the answer is “no,” then the result is a belief in relativism. Relativism can be described by the words of Friedrich Nietzsche, who writes, “You have your way, I have my way. As for the right way, it does not exist.” This belief, then, would result in a form of morality that is built upon one’s relative experiences and the rules that are mutually agreed upon between persons. Think for a minute about a world in which every person was governed by his own desires. Is it a pretty place? I think not. If the answer to the above question is yes, then there is a universal standard for deciphering whether or not certain beliefs and practices are right or wrong. This article examines the arguments for the existence of a moral and absolute truth.
 
## God Affirms Truth
God cannot exist and not exist at the same time. If God indeed exists and is the Creator of the universe, then He is the all-knowing, all-powerful, and everywhere-present true God of all. Therefore, anything that comes from Him is true and truth is inherent in His very existence. This idea is asserted in John 14:6 where Jesus stated, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”
 
The doctrine of relativism affirms that truth is relative to each person’s cultural upbringing, situation, desire, or frame of reference, etc. If a supreme God exists, then He would not be subject to a particular upbringing, situation, or frame of reference because of His very nature. He transcends the natural world and, therefore, would not be bound by it. Numbers 23:19 asserts, “God is not man, that He should lie, or a son of man, that He should change His mind. Has He said, and will He not do it? Or has He spoken, and will He not fulfill it?” James 1:17 says, “Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.”
 
## The Universe Affirms Truth
The word science simply means "knowledge." Science examines what we know and helps us as we strive to build on that knowledge. Thus, science is founded on the belief that the universe can be defined in non-relative terms. But we don’t even need science to tell us things that we already know from experience. Before science defined gravity in quantifiable parameters, mankind knew that things fall to the earth when unsupported. Gravity applies every time an object is dropped and does not depend on one’s determination or acceptance of it. Mankind can see many laws that govern the universe’s behavior and remain true at all times and in every circumstance.
 
## Mankind Affirms Truth
A third evidence for the existence of a moral and absolute truth is mankind’s morality. Though perhaps this is a lesser evidence in magnitude to the first two evidences, mankind universally and historically desires to know what they should do, and what they should not do. One might believe that this was only the product of cultural upbringing, religion, or pressure to conform to authority, like government. Those very institutions are built upon the idea of defining what should and should not be done. As a result, this desire can be shown to exist throughout various types of cultures, governments, and time periods. It is as if this desire to conform to an absolute truth is innate.
 
The Bible puts it more beautifully in Romans 2:14-15: “Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law, since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them”.
 
The impossibility of proving relativism
One cannot logically argue for relativism. The phrases “there is no absolute truth” or “morality is determined by one’s relative experiences” are self-defeating. This is the case because the statements asserts an absolute truth. These statements innately set up an absolute truth that excludes all others.
 
## Conclusion
If we consider the existence of a true God and examine the universe, and more personally, ourselves, we’ll find that all things point to the existence of a governing law of truth. This truth transcends mankind, but is still accessible. However, it is accessible only through Jesus, the ultimate embodiment of truth ( John 14:6 ). Through Him we see the path of truth. This path tells us where we came from, why we are here, how to stay on the correct path, and informs us concerning the goal.
