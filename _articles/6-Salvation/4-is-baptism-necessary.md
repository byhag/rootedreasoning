When considering this topic, we must examine the passages we have from God and come to the most straightforward conclusion. There are only two options: baptism is necessary for salvation or not necessary for salvation. The Christian religious community is divided into these two groups of thought despite the fact that in Paul’s letter to the Ephesians he claims there is “one baptism” (Ephesians 4:4-6). Thus, conversations about the necessity of baptism (or the lack thereof) not only have implications for each group’s salvation but also for the unity of the two parties.
 
## The Necessity of Baptism
In the New Testament, baptism is referred to as the beginning of our covenant relationship with God. In Colossians 2:9-14, baptism is compared to circumcision, the sign of the Jewish covenant. When God’s covenant with Abraham began (Genesis 17:1-14), circumcision was the symbol of the new relationship between God and Abraham’s descendants, the Jews. If someone in Abraham’s family was not circumcised, he was to be “cut off” from the people (Genesis 17:14). For example, Moses was almost killed because he had not circumcised his children (Exodus 4:24-25). When we move into the New Testament, baptism is tied to how we become heirs to the promises given to Abraham (Galatians 3:27-29). If we are baptized, we are Christ’s. If we are Christ’s, we are Abraham’s. And if we are Abraham’s, we will receive the promises of the covenant.
 
The Bible plainly teaches that baptism is directly tied to salvation and remission of sins. For example, 1 Peter 3:21 teaches that baptism corresponds to the salvation of Noah and his family experiences. Just as Noah and his family were cleansed from the wickedness of the world and were given a fresh start, baptism gives Christians remission of sins through faith. Jesus says in Mark 16:16 says that he who both believes and is baptized will be saved. In Romans 6:1-11, baptism is said to mean “newness of life” for Christians. In Colossians 2:13, Paul says that through baptism, God makes us alive in Christ.
 
## Rebuttal of Arguments Against the Necessity of Baptism
**Some might say: “Baptism is a work or ceremony. We are not saved by works, but by grace. (Ephesians 2:8-9)”.**

We are, in fact, saved by grace and not by works. But the Bible does not talked about baptism as a work that deserves salvation. In the book of Colossians, Paul talks about baptism as something that is done by and through “the powerful working of God”. Thus, it is God that truly does the work here, not man. (Colossians 2:11-14)

​
**Some might say: “We are saved by faith. (John 5:24; Romans 3:28, 4:5, 5:1; Galatians 2:16, 2:21, 5:6)”.**

This, again, is true. But the Bible must agree. If there are passages about faith being necessary and baptism being necessary, then both are necessary (Mark 16:16). In the book of Colossians, Paul talks about baptism as something that done “in faith”. Thus, baptism is a furtherance of faith, and not something separate from faith (Colossians 2:11-14). Before Paul was baptized, he already had faith, but was still told to be baptized for forgiveness of his sins (Acts 22:16).
 
**Some might say: “The thief on the cross was saved without baptism. (Luke 23:33-43)”**

Jesus had the authority to forgive sins and grant salvation (Matthew 9:1-8). Jesus had the power to grant salvation, but he is no longer on earth as he once was. Additionally, the thief belonged to the Jewish covenant. The new covenant began with the death of Jesus (Hebrews 9:15-22) and be baptized into Christ did not occur until 40 days later (Acts 2).
​

**Some might ask: “What happens if you die while driving to be baptized?” or “What happens if water is not available?”**

“What ifs” can be imagined for most arguments. What if someone does not have the time to pray to God to accept Jesus as his Lord and Savior? We must remember that God will judge fairly (Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalms 7:11). We should take advantage of opportunities while it is still called today (Hebrews 3:13). 

**Some might say: “The verses speaking of the necessity of baptism refer to baptism of the heart or Holy Spirit baptism, not water baptism.”**

Several verses explicitly mention immersion in water (Acts 8:36; 1 Peter 3:21). There are only six verses that speak of Holy Spirit baptism. The first four are a prophecy from John that Jesus would baptize with the Holy Spirit. In Acts 11:16, Peter interprets this prophecy to mean what happened in Acts 2 and 10, the miraculous outpouring of the Spirit on the apostles and Cornelius’s household. We have no other reason to conclude that the Holy Spirit baptism occurred elsewhere. (Matthew 3:11; Mark 1:8; Luke 3:16; John 1:33; Acts 1:5, 11:16)
 
**Some might say: “Cornelius’s household was saved without baptism, evidenced by the miraculous outpouring of the Spirit. (Acts 10:34-48)”**

In Peter’s recounting of this event, he believed that the Holy Spirit was given as a sign, just as the apostles had received the Holy Spirit in Acts 2 (Acts 10:47, 11:16-18). Also, if there was any ambiguity about their situation, they were still commanded to be baptized in the name of Christ immediately afterwards (Acts 10:48).
 
**Some might say: “Baptism is an outward sign of an inward grace” or “Baptism is a proclamation of faith” or “Baptism for admittance into a certain faith or church”.**

Peter and Paul state its purpose is for forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38; Colossians 2:11-14). If the purpose is for some other reason, how did that idea come about?
 
## Conclusion
What does the Bible teach? No matter what the consequences, we must be united in what the Bible says about the “one baptism” (Ephesians 4:5). Baptism is a sign of the beginning of our covenant with God in water for the forgiveness of sins.
 
Ananias said to Paul (Acts 22:16) “And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name.’”
 
I ask you: why do you wait?
