The preceding arguments do not prove a God of any particular religion, including the God of Christianity. At best, our observations so far support evidence of a very unique Mind or a Cause behind the universe and our conscience. However, let us summarize what the preceding arguments can tell us about this being. For the sake of simplicity, let us call this supernatural entity “God”.
​ 

## God is outside of physical reality
When establishing the necessity for an uncaused or first cause, we saw that God is different than anything else because He always existed. Given this characteristic of God’s nature, God cannot exist inside our universe because everything in our universe has a cause to its existence.
 
Since God exists outside of our universe, then it would be unreasonable to attribute any physical traits to him. Objects that take up space, for instance, do so as a result of being made up of physical substance. Physical substance requires a cause for its existence. Therefore, God is not made of physical particles.
 
## God is the powerful creator
In order to be the cause for the existence of the entire universe, we would expect that God would have power beyond anything with which we are familiar. This power would certainly be worthy of awe and wonder, even fear. Being the Creator of the universe, we are at the mercy of His “will” and power.
 
## God is concerned about mankind and goodness
God created a standard between what should be done and what shouldn’t be done. Therefore, He is both interested in what should and shouldn’t be done as well as man who has been given this choice. If there is a law concerning the speed limit on a particular road, then it must mean that the makers of such a law are both concerned with what speeds should and shouldn’t be driven, as well as the drivers who are given a choice to obey the law.
 
God seems to care about man doing good. Yet, based off of the arguments so far, this “care” or “concern” lacks the usual benevolent or loving sense of those words. The standard by which man operates, which comes from God, is as hard as nails and must be in order to achieve its purpose.
 
## God is personal
While God’s laws regarding what man should and should not do are absolute, He is not a dictator or an unfeeling mind, controlling the universe at His own whims. He is knowable and personal. There are only a few things that are thought to be able to exist without physically existing. Abstract objects such as numbers fall into this category, however these are not thought of as having any creative power. Numbers exist. Their existence is undeniable because we use them every day. However, they are not tangible in the normal sense. We cannot touch the number “One” or point as a “Three” runs down the street. We know and see them by the things that represent them - one apple, two dogs, three flowers. The same thought applies to the supernatural, namely, to God, a consciousness outside of physical reality. Though we cannot physically see God or pinpoint His tangible matter, God exists. He is knowable. He is personal. This explanation gives us a much more satisfying understanding of our own self-awareness and morality than mere chance, evolution,  or social condition.
 
## Conclusion
Given what we can observe about the universe around us and ourselves, it is reasonable to conclude that there is a powerful, personal Creator concerned about mankind’s existence.

However, God has not left us to wander in search for him. Instead, he has spoken to us about who he is and what we need to know. The next branch, truth, discusses this topic.
