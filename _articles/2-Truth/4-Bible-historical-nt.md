Like the preceding article, we are considering evidence to determine whether or not the Bible is just a book of “fables” or “legends” or an accurate, historical document. Can the events read written the pages of the Bible be considered as historical fact? This article focuses on the second half of the Bible, the New Testament, while the preceding article focuses on the first half, the Old Testament.
 
## Politarchs of Thessalonica
In Acts 17:5-8, Luke writes that that some of the brethren had been brought before the “rulers of the city”. The phrase “rulers of the city” is translated from the Greek word politarchas, and occurs only in Acts 17 verses 6 and 8. Critics argued that Luke’s writing could not be historically accurate because only more common words like strateegoi (magistrates) or exousiais (authorities) were used as titles for city government.
 
However, in 1960, Carl Schuler published that he discovered 32 inscriptions bearing the title politarchas, 19 of which came from Thessalonica, and three of them dating to the first century [[1]]({{page.permalink}}/#References). Now housed in the British Museum, one of the inscriptions that was written on an arch called the Vardar Gate, begins with, “In the time of Politarchas...” [[2]]({{page.permalink}}/#References). This arch was most likely part of the city architecture while Luke walked the streets of Thessalonica.
 
## Sergius Paulus
In Acts 13:4-7, Paul and his companions are said to have appeared before the proconsul of Cyprus during their travels on the island. The proconsul, Sergius Paulus by name, was said to be an intelligent man and desired to hear the word of God. For some time, skeptics to the historicity of the New Testament doubted that Cyprus would have been ruled by a proconsul, given that it was an imperial province that would have been under a “propraetor” [[3]]({{page.permalink}}/#References).
 
However, a great deal of evidence has surfaced to say that that Cyprus was ruled by a proconsul and was not an imperial province during Paul’s travels there. In fact, “in 22 B.C. Augustus transferred it to the Roman Senate, and it was therefore placed under the administration of proconsuls” [[4]]({{page.permalink}}/#References). Additionally, copper coins were found from around the time of Paul’s travels. One such coin, called appropriately a “copper proconsular coin of Cyprus,” pictures the head of Claudius Caesar, and contains the title of “Arminius Proclus, Proconsul…of the Cyprians” [[5]]({{page.permalink}}/#References). Finally, there are several inscriptions that most likely match the same Sergius Paulus. One of these inscriptions, a fragmentary Greek inscription hailing from Kythrea in northern Cyprus has been discovered refers to a Quintus Sergius Paulus as a proconsul during the reign of Claudius [[6]]({{page.permalink}}/#References).
 
## The Pool of Bethesda
In  John 5:2-9, it is said that Jesus heals a paralytic at the Pool of Bethesda, a Roman made mikveh, or Jewish ritual bath outside of Jerusalem. The pool was described as a 5 sided portico, or what we’d think of as a five sided porch. Due to the peculiarity of the features of this pools, it was dismissed by some as a literary creation.
 
Though the existence of a rectangular pool outside of Jerusalem has been known of for some time, it was discovered around 1900 that the small dam and porch ran through the middle of the pool [[7]]({{page.permalink}}/#References). With a porch through its middle, it would, in fact, have five porticos. The upper pool, which could have supplied the temple with water, ran over the dam into the lower pool, where disabled men and women went for healing. This confirms the biblical account.
 
## Erastus
In Romans 16:23, Paul describes a Corinthian city treasurer named Erastus whom he considered as a brother. The particular Greek word used by Paul for ‘treasurer’ (oikonomos) is an term that was used at the time to describe the work of a Corinthian aedile or magistrate supervising public works. [[8]]({{page.permalink}}/#References)
 
This biblical detail was confirmed due to an excavation in a section Corinth, Greece that dated to antiquity. A 62 square feet pavement was found at the northeast corner of the ancient theatre. Excavations there revealed part of a Latin inscription carved into the pavement which reads, ‘Erastus in return for his aedileship laid [the pavement] at his own expense.’ [[9]]({{page.permalink}}/#References) There is good evidence to say, then, that this Erastus and the Erastus in Romans 16:23 are one and the same.
 
## Conclusion
If the Bible was written by men outside of the historical period that it was claimed to have been written, we would expect that the Bible would contain numerous inaccuracies. Either that, or else we’d expect a lack of detail of names of rulers, locations, and cultural practices. Instead, we find that the Bible contains numerous details that align over and over again with history and archaeological finds. Though this doesn’t prove that God wrote the Bible, it does give a measure of evidence to that claim (which will discussed in more detail in the following articles). The evidence shows that this Bible is indeed a historical document.
