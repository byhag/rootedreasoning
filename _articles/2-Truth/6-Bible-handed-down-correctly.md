In the previous articles, evidence was given to support the conclusion that when the Bible was written, it was inspired by God. However, given that the New Testament writings were completed by about 100 A.D., how do we know that the Bible hasn’t been corrupted since its original writing?
 
A popular example that is usually provided at this point is that the children’s game called, “Telephone.” In this game, children are placed into a line, the first child is whispered something, and then is told to repeat the phrase to the next child. By the time, the whispers have gotten to the end of the line, it is very unlike the beginning phrase and much more humorous. Has the transmission of the Bible been a long game of telephone with a grossly distorted message handed down to us?
 
Fortunately, the transmission of Biblical texts operates very differently from the game of telephone. In fact, the transmission of the Bible is far less a matter of religious study, and more a matter of academic study due the vast number of new testament manuscripts. This article briefly discusses the evidence concerning whether or not the Bible was translated effectively.
 
## The number of manuscripts
First, the sheer number of manuscripts attests to the credibility of the Bible. Examining the manuscript evidence from other writers from antiquity, like Plato, Tacitus, and Aristotle (see Table 1) [[1]]({{page.permalink}}/#References), we find that there are very few manuscripts by which we can reconstruct their works. Additionally, the earliest copy found of their works are found a millennium after their writing.
 
When we consider the New Testament, however, we find the manuscripts tell a different story. There are about 5600 Greek manuscripts (the original language of the New Testament) and the earliest recorded is within 100 years of the original document. [[2]]({{page.permalink}}/#References) There are a total of 230 manuscript portions that pre-date 600 AD, including 192 Greek New Testament manuscripts, 5 Greek lectionaries containing scripture, and 33 translations of the Greek New Testament. [[2]]({{page.permalink}}/#References) If we trust the authenticity of the works of writers such as Plato and Aristotle, then we should trust the authenticity of the New Testament.

## The early manuscripts
One might think, “well, there are a great number of early manuscripts, but how significant are those manuscripts to the reconstruction of the New Testament?” It is true, some of the manuscripts are little more than small scraps of papyrus, worn by age and elements. However, there are several early manuscripts that alone comprise most or all of the New Testament. These are some of the most important witnesses to the New Testament account [[3]]({{page.permalink}}/#References):
 
- The Chester Beatty Papyrus II is the earliest large piece of the New Testament known to exist. This contains most of Paul's letters copied circa AD 100.
- The John Rylands Manuscript contains part of the Gospel of John copied in AD 130.
- The Codex Vaticanus is a Greek copy of the entire Old Testament and most of the New Testament and was copied between the years 325 and 350.
- The Codex Sinaiticus was penned circa AD 375-400 and contains all of the New Testament and most of the Old Testament.
- The Codex Alexandrinus is a fifth-century manuscript of the Greek Bible, containing the majority of the Septuagint and the New Testament.
 
## The variance of the manuscripts
Another might think, “well, there are a great number of early manuscripts, but how different are they from one another?” One might expect that given the number, the amount of time that passed between each manuscript, and the number of half dozen languages the manuscripts are written in, there would be a great number of variations in style and meaning between them.
 
It is true, there are about 20,000 variants within the broad spectrum of manuscripts. Of these, the overwhelming majority are minor scribal errors such as differences in spelling (misspellings or alternative spellings). Of some 2,500 real differences, only about 300 involve any substantial difference in meaning (like “in Christ” and “in God”) [[4]]({{page.permalink}}/#References). These variants involve less than one tenth of one percent of the text of the New Testament. The numbers of variants that actually affect the meaning—not just spelling—of the text are minuscule, and are not significant enough to affect doctrinal beliefs or the accuracy of the overall text.
 
Judaic scholar, archaeologist and linguist Dr. Randall Price concluded: “The New Testament manuscripts agree in 99.5% of the text, a greater percentage by far than for any other ancient literary work.” Further, “Recall that we have all of the variants that make up the Original Bible somewhere in our vast number of manuscripts, and that textual criticism has so far been able to bring our state of the text very close to the wording of the original…. By comparison with secular literature, we have in the Bible, hands down, the best and most complete text in all of human history.” [[5]]({{page.permalink}}/#References)
 
## Conclusion
The transmission of the Bible can be accurately confirmed by the large number of manuscripts that bear witness to the text. If we examine the manuscripts, we’d find that there are a number of early manuscripts by which we can construct the entirely of the New Testament. We’d also find that the main variants between manuscripts are not the copier’s bias like we would expect, but only differences in spelling.
 
The evidence concerning the transmission of the New Testament points us to the conclusion that the New Testament has been carefully passed down through the centuries. Therefore, if the New Testament was inspired by God at the time of its writing, then we can be assured that the New Testament is inspired by God today.
