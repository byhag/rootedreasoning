If you have been reading and have been convicted, realizing that you are a sinner, that is, someone who has committed sin against God, then you know that your sin makes you infinitely separated from God, because God, by nature, is infinitely separately from sin and evil. If you believe this, then you know that you are in a pretty tight spot and need help. The questions then is, “How can I be saved?”
​

## Through Jesus
The answer is simple. It is through Jesus. He is the only way to God (John 14:6). He is the only one who reveals God to mankind (Matthew 11:27). Christ, both God and man, is only man who can connect us to God because He is the only one who could make the payment for our sins (1 Peter 2:24).
 

## Through faith
However, this salvation is not automatically given to all of mankind once Christ died. Jesus said that only a few “find” salvation (Matthew 7:13-14). On another occasion, he said that “Many are called, but few are chosen” (Matthew 22:14).
 
How then, can we be one of the “few”? Jesus clearly states that it is through faith, or a dutiful conviction, in Him (John 3:16). It is through Jesus through faith that we have peace with God (Romans 5:1-2). True faith can only be achieved by those who trust so fully in God that they give themselves completely to Him. This giving is done by pure, simple obedience (John 14:15). In doing so, we become partakers in Christ’s grace (Ephesians 2:8-10, 2 Peter 1:3-4), through faith and the death and resurrection of Christ which the Bible tells us in through baptism (Romans 6:3-4).
 
## Through baptism
One who is baptized, that is, immersed in water, through faith, is saved (1 Peter 3:21). It is through faith through baptism that Christ makes us alive with God (Colossians 2:11-14). Jesus says that those who “believe and are baptized will be saved” (Mark 16:16).  It is from faith through baptism that we become sons of God (Galatians 3:25-27).
 
What is baptism? Baptism is a being immersed in water through faith in Jesus (1 Peter 3:21). It is through this water that Christ’s atoning blood saves us from our sins. Just as He died and was raised, we die to our sins and are raised up anew with Christ (Romans 6:3-11).
 
If we examine the accounts of salvation in the historical book of Acts, we’d find that accounts of someone who gained a faith in Jesus is baptized shortly after for the forgiveness of their sins. For example, when the Jewish people were convicted about Jesus, they asked the followers of Jesus, “What shall we do?”. Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins…” (Acts 2:37-38). Later in Acts, a certain man asked “What shall I do to be saved?” Paul replied that he should believe, and then the man was baptized at once (Acts 16:30-33). If faith is the means, then baptism is the medium.
 
## Conclusion
Salvation comes through Christ through faith through baptism. It is in baptism that we die to ourselves and live to God, demonstrating our faith and belief in Jesus Christ. However, an active and true faith does not stop there. It is one that is more than just a belief. It continues to grow, and it confesses itself to others. We must strive to make our salvation sure (2 Peter 1:3-11). More about this is discussed in the next lesson.
