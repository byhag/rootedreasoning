Satan. We have all heard his name, read of him in literature, screamed at movies depicting his demons, or noticed when something bears the number 666, but what do we really know about Satan? Scripture does not reveal everything we would like to know of him. Naturally, we seek answers because we are fascinated by the unseen realm, but, more importantly, we should want to know of him because he is the enemy of God and His followers. Knowing one’s enemy is critical to overcoming him. The apostle Paul cautioned that an awareness of the devil’s schemes is essential to not being taken advantage by him (2 Corinthians 2:11). For brevity sake, we’ll forgo questions of his origin, his dissent against God and the resulting descent from God, and focus instead on: What are his purposes? What is his plan of attack? What, if any powers does he wield? Finally, what hope do we have of defeating him?
 
## His Purpose
Perhaps the clearest indication of his purposes can be seen in the ungodly names and descriptions ascribed to him by the Holy Spirit. Some of which are: Satan (“adversary”; Zechariah 3:1) the devil (slanderer,  Matthew 4:1); the father of lies (John 8:44); the “Great Dragon” (Revelation 12:9); “Beelzebub” (prince of demons; Matthew 12:24); the ruler of darkness (Ephesians 6:12); “the tempter” (1 Thessalonians 3:5); a “murderer” (John 8:44); “the enemy” (Matthew 13:39); “a roaring lion seeking to devour” (1 Peter 5:8); a “serpent” (2 Corinthians 11:3).
 
A cursory reading of the above list should be enough to strike fear into the hearts of any sober minded individual. Simply stated, his mission is the utter destruction of all humanity in hell by enslaving men to his will. He will use any means available to him to alienate men from God by enticing us to sin. He engages in this work with feverish intensity (Job 1:7).
 
Someone may ask, “why does Satan hate us so much?” As is often the case, it really isn’t about us, primarily. Satan hates God and lives to complicate His will for us. For further insight, read the first two chapters of Job to see what may be learned of the perpetual contest (quarrel) between God and Satan.
 
## His Plan
The devil demonstrated his plan of attack early on, with the first family in the garden (Gen. 3:1-7). In his craftiness, he targeted Eve for her gullibility (1 Timothy 2:14) by getting her to wonder about the one thing she couldn't have. In so doing, he caused her to be discontent by awakening her appetite for more, even though she had every good thing at her disposal. In so doing, the devil caused her to forget to be thankful to God for all of the wonderful trees from which she could eat.
 
Next, Satan attempted to drive a wedge between God and men by causing her to be distrusting of God and doubtful of His promises. He got her thinking about whether God had ulterior motives for restricting access to that one tree, that perhaps God was holding them back from some good thing. Notice how he sprinkled in just enough truth (their eyes were opened to good and evil) but what he didn't tell them was that this new condition would be a curse and not a blessing.
 
## His Power(s)
There can be no doubt that, as “god of this world” (2 Corinthians 4:4), Satan is powerful in his own right. But as powerful as he is, he is not omnipotent—a fact that even he recognizes. During his temptation of Christ, he admitted that his earthly dominion had been delivered to him (Luke 4:6). Likewise, the devil was incapable of harming Job in any way without the expressed permission of God (Job 1:12; 2:6). Similarly, when he sought to “sift” Peter “as wheat”, he first had to “ask” for him (Luke 22:31). It is evident, therefore, that his power is limited. From this we may safely conclude that the devil is not on the same plane as God. He is not divine.
 
His power, then, is a power of persuasion and perversion. He perverts the Word of God (Genesis 3:1-4). He promulgates false doctrine (1 Timothy 4:1-3). He blinds men to the truth (2 Corinthians 4:4). He steals the Word of God from human hearts (Matthew 13:19). He lays snares for men (2 Timothy 2:26; 1 Timothy 3:7). He tempts (Matthew 4:1; Ephesians 6:11). He afflicts (Job 2:7; 2 Corinthians 12:7). He deceives (Revelation 12:9; Revelation 20:8-10). He undermines the sanctity of the home, even when a man or woman might be at their weakest (1 Corinthians 7:3-5). He hinders the work of God’s servants (1 Thessalonians 2:18). And he even makes accusations against God’s children before Heaven’s throne (Job 1:6-11; Job 2:3-6; Zechariah 3:1-4; Revelation 12:9-10).
​

## His Prospects
What hope could we have against such a formidable foe? Fortunately, God has not left us defenseless. In Ephesians 6:11, Paul admonished Christians to “put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil.” It is more than adequate to overcome the enemy, but not unless we are willing to put it on. Consider David and Goliath - a story with which many are familiar. We are David and Satan is our Goliath. David triumphed not by his own strength or armor but by his faith in the Lord. This is just like our armor that Paul describes. If we are willing to wear it, we can triumph.
 
The scriptures affirm that “He [God] who is in us is greater than he [Satan] that is in the world” (1 John 4:4). No book makes this clearer than the Revelation of Jesus Christ to John. Besides offering comfort to persecuted Christians, the message of Revelation is that of ultimate victory over the devil and his forces. The Lamb demonstrated His power by prevailing against the dragon and casting him out of His presence (Revelation 12:7-9). The twentieth chapter, presents a subjugated enemy being “bound” (Revelation 20:2) and “cast into the abyss” (Revelation 20:3), where he remains to this day. In the final day, we are told that Satan will be loosed; he will rally his forces, and with great pomp he will prepare for one great last stand. Then, in very anticlimactic fashion, the battle will be ended, almost before it even had a chance to begin (Revelation 20:7-10).
 
## Conclusion
The Lord will be victorious over Satan. To believe otherwise is to believe that Jesus failed at His mission. In Hebrews 2:14, the author declared that Jesus, "through death might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil. It was for this purpose that the Son of Man was revealed, that he might destroy the works of the devil” (I John 3:8). The fate that awaits him after God puts an immediate end to Satan's insurrection is spelled out with great clarity in Revelation 20:10:
 
“And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false prophet; and they shall be tormented day and night forever and ever.” Eternal punishment in hell has been prepared, not for you and me, but "for the devil and his angels” (Matthew 25:41). Let us be sober, and vigilant (1 Peter 5:8). "Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God." (1 John 5:5).
