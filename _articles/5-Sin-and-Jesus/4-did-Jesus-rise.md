“To preach Christianity meant (to the Apostles) primarily to preach the resurrection…The resurrection is the central theme in every Christian sermon reported in the Acts. The resurrection, and its consequences, were the ‘gospel’ or good news which the Christians brought”. [[1]]({{page.permalink}}/#References)
​
The resurrection of Jesus is not only the theme of the early Christian writings, but is also recognized as providing substantial evidence that Jesus is the Son of God and the “good news” that was brought. Therefore, proving the authenticity of His resurrection is crucial to Christianity. This article examines the logical explanations for the resurrection of Jesus.
 
## Was the Tomb Empty?
If the tomb was not empty, then the Jews, who were the ruling officials and whose religious beliefs opposed those held by Christians, would gladly have gone to the tomb for the purpose of producing the lifeless body of Jesus in order to disprove His resurrection. Since this did not occur, we can be certain that beginning the third day following His death Jesus’ body was no longer in the tomb. Furthermore, according to the Bible, the Jews paid the Roman soldiers who guarded the tomb to lie that the disciples of Jesus stole his body while they slept (Matthew 28:11-15).
 
## How Did the Tomb Become Empty?

####  **1. Did the Jews steal His body?** 
If so, they would be helping to prove the one thing they sought to disprove, i.e. that Jesus was the resurrected Son of God, as the Christians claimed. If they did steal His body they could have easily displayed the body once the disciples began proclaiming His resurrection.
 
####  **2. Did the disciples steal His body?**
What would the disciples have gained? There is no evidence to believe they received earthly power or monetary gain. If the biblical account is true, the disciples would have had to overpower Roman soldiers, break the seal around the tomb, move the stone, and carry the body out (Matthew 27:62-66). At the time, the disciples were fearful for their own lives (John 20:19) after fleeing the scene following Jesus’s arrest (Mark 14:50).
 
####  **3. Did someone not associated with either of the above groups steal His body?**
What motivation would they have? Had wealth been the motivation, the Jews would gladly have purchased the body in order to bear witness that Jesus had not risen. If the biblical account is true, these supposed grave robbers would also have had to overpower the guards, break the seal around the tomb, move the stone, and carry the body out (Matthew 27:62-66).
 
####  **4. Did Jesus not actually die and remove the stone Himself?**
If Jesus “suffered the extreme penalty” [[2]]({{page.permalink}}/#References), he would not have the strength to remove the typical Jewish burial stones. Additionally, He then would have to appear to many disciples before eventually dying. Again, his disciples would have gained nothing for perpetuating a lie. For more reading about the physical torture that Jesus went through during and before the resurrection, see here [[3]]({{page.permalink}}/#References).
 
####  **5. Did Jesus truly rise?**
First, consider the confessions of two individuals that were initially opposed to “the Christ”. , These two individuals were James, the brother of Jesus, and Paul, a devout Jew. According to the biblical account, James did not believe Jesus was the Son of God prior to Jesus’s death (John 7:3-5), though he was his brother. However, Jesus appeared to his brother James following his death (1 Corinthians 15:7). Then, we later find that James was a prominent leader in the movement called Christianity (Acts 15:13-21; Galatians 1:18-19; Acts 21:18-26). Finally, he was stoned at the hands of Ananus the high priest [[4]]({{page.permalink}}/#References). What would cause this change, besides if the skeptical James was convinced his brother rose from the dead?
 
Additionally, Paul was an opponent to Jesus’s claims. According to the biblical account, Paul was devout Jew and persecutor of Christians (Acts 22:3-5). However, he later became a Christian after supposedly seeing the resurrected Jesus on the road to persecuting more Christians (Acts 22:6-11). Following his conversion he was almost killed by devout Jews (Acts 9:23-25). What would cause so complete a change in one who sought to wipeout Christ’s followers? I would argue that nothing short of seeing the resurrected One would convince such a devout Jew.
 
Second, consider the multitude of witnesses. According to the biblical account, Paul claimed that Jesus appeared to over 500 people at once following his coming back to life. If the claim of Jesus’ resurrection was a lie, wouldn’t the disciples have been wise to instead claim that He only appeared to a few? The disciples chose to begin their teaching in Jerusalem, the very place where Jesus was killed and the very environment in which their teaching could easily be proven false, if Jesus had not risen. The movement of Christianity would not have survived a month in Jerusalem if Jesus was not raised. If there were witnesses hostile to the Christian faith, they could have easily shown the resurrection was false by producing the lifeless body of Jesus.
 
Third, consider the motivation of the witnesses. If there were any visible benefits for becoming a whole-hearted follower and preacher of the “risen Christ” such as power, popularity, or wealth, we could logically account for their actions. However, history tells us that the early Christians were killed and treated very poorly from Jews, pagans, and Romans. How could telling this grand lie be worth it?
​

## Conclusion
The radical belief that a man rose from the dead cannot be believed without evidence. This would have been true for those in the first century and is also true for us today. This belief could not have lasted an hour without there being an empty tomb. Who would dare take the body? There was no motivation or explanation for any group other than the disciples to take the body. And while the disciples may have desired to take it, why would they, knowing they would die with the knowledge that it was all a hoax? People sometimes die for something they believe is true, but how many would be willing to die for something they know is a lie?
 
Though I have never seen someone rise from the dead, and I certainly never saw the risen Jesus, I must silence the doubts within my mind with the same evidence that astounded those in the first century.
