A prophecy is a prediction about the future that has divine origins. There are five conceivable reasons for how a so-called “prophecy” could potentially be fulfilled. First, it could be fulfilled because of sheer luck. Second, the prophecy was actually made after the prophecy was fulfilled. Third, interpreters twist the words of the prophecy so that they meet the fulfillment. Fourth, someone knew about the prophecy and helped to aid the fulfilling of the prophecy. Finally, the prophecy could be from God.
 
Conceivably, if a so-called “prophecy” is not due to one of the first four reasons, then it must be the fifth reason, from God. So, if a prophecy is not just a lucky guess, was made sufficiently before its fulfillment, was not twisted by its interpreters, and was not self-fulfilled, then it is from God. If the Bible is proven to be a prophetic book, then it is a book from God.
 
This page is devoted to prophecies centered around Jesus, or said to be fulfilled in Jesus. Considering that dozens of prophecies are pertaining to Jesus, only a select few are chosen for discussion here.
 
All of these prophecies can be easily be verified to have been penned before the birth of Jesus. We can know this with certainty because the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, was penned around 250 BC by 72 Jewish translators and contains all of the prophecies concerning Jesus [[1]]({{page.permalink}}/#References).
 
## The Bethlehem prophecy
In Micah 5:2, written around 800 BC, it says, “But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.” In Matthew 2:1, it is written, “Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea”.
 
In this prophecy, it is said that a ruler, “of ancient days”, would come out of Bethlehem Ephrathah, a small rural community south of Jerusalem. In ancient Israel there was an additional Bethlehem north of Jerusalem near the Sea of Galilee which was much nearer to Jesus’ hometown of Nazareth. It is not only specific which small community the ruler would come from, but which Bethlehem.
 
By all accounts, it would be highly unlikely that this prophecy could be fulfilled through Jesus by sheer luck- the odds are insurmountable. The interpretation of this prophecy could not be twisted because it is so explicit in detail (who else could be this “ruler of old”?). It could not be self-fulfilled because there is no way that Jesus could have impacted the place of his birth. Is there a natural means for explaining this prophecy?
 
## The Wages prophecy
In Zechariah 11:12-13, it says, “Then I said to them, “If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.” And they weighed out as my wages thirty pieces of silver. Then the Lord said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the Lord, to the potter.” In Matthew 26:15, it says, “ “What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?” And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.” A chapter later, in Matthew 27:3-8, it says, “Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” They said, “What is that to us? See to it yourself.” And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money.” So they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field as a burial place for strangers. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.”
 
In Zechariah, a man is described who asks for his wages, is given thirty pieces of silver, but then throws the silver into the house of the Lord for the potter. In Matthew, we read that Judas, the man that played a key role in the arrest of Jesus, was given 30 shekels of silver for agreeing to lead them to Jesus, but then mourns his deed and decides to return the money. When they refuse to take it, he throws it into the house of the Lord, the temple, which would be used later to purchase a potter’s field for the burial place for non-Jews.
 
The amount of money, the type of money, the return of the money, and the future use of the money all align with exact precision in these two sets of verses. If it was sheer luck, it would have to be extremely unlikely. It would be very difficult to twist the meaning of this prophecy, because it is so exact in detail. Additionally, Jesus had very little control of the fulfillment of this prophecy, given that Judas was clearly an enemy. What is the one remaining explanation for these facts?
 
## The Suffering Servant prophecy
Another example of a prophecy is Isaiah 52:13-15 and Isaiah 53:1-12. Many passages in the New Testament have been attributed to the fulfillment of this prophecy, including a few mentioned here (Matthew 8:17; Mark 15:28; Luke 22:37; John 12:38; Acts 8:32; Romans 10:16; 1 Peter 2:22; 1 Peter 2:24).
 
The Isaiah passages speak of a singular individual who will be “lifted up” (52:13), who was “marred beyond human appearance” (52:14), who was not listened to (52:15), and who was not esteemed because of his background or appearance (53:2). He was despised by men (53:3), who was said to have been smitten by God (53:4), who was punished for others’ wrongs to bring peace (53:5), and who was silent when he was led to his death (53:7). His death and suffering was the will of God (53:10), but through it, many are accounted as righteous (53:11).
 
In the New Testament, we read Jesus was born in a small rural community of Bethlehem, and raised in the rural community of Nazareth, far away from the hub of Jerusalem. He grew up with a low socioeconomic status as the son of a carpenter. We read that he was misunderstood about his teachings, betrayed by a friend, and tried before the Roman and Jewish leaders, though he was silent before his accusers. He was later tortured, and later mocked as he was led through the streets of Jerusalem to where he would be “lifted up” (a idiom for crucifixion), a particularly humiliating and excruciating Roman punishment. The New Testament also explains why he died - that through his death, many could be saved.
 
The similarities between these two accounts are striking, ruling out sheer coincidence and twisted interpretation of the prophecy as potential causes. Jesus very well could have known about this prophecy, but why would he want to fulfill it? What motivation would he have to purposefully go through humiliation and death if it was simply for a lie?
 
## Conclusion
Look at these prophecies and see. Could they be explained by natural means?
 
The evidence points to someone that holds both the past and future in His hand - God. He gave us His Word. Included in his Word is evidence, namely prophecy, that points back to Him, and to His Son to whom the prophecies pertain.
