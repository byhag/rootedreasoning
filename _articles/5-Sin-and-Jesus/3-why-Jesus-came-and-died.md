The universal symbol for Christianity is the cross. Church buildings are adorned with crosses. Necklaces are earrings are fashioned into crosses. Some people even tattoo their bodies with crosses.
 
All of this would have seemed bizarre – even grisly – to the people of the time of the New Testament. For them, the cross was not a decoration, but an obscenity. The Roman statesmen Cicero wrote, “The very word cross should be removed not only from the person of a Roman citizen, but from his thoughts, his eyes, his ears . . .The very mention of these things is unworthy of a Roman citizen.” [[1]]({{page.permalink}}/#References) The cross was the means of execution for criminals of the lowest class. Designed to torture its victims and terrify the populace, crucifixion was brutal and degrading.
 
And yet Christians believe that Jesus of Nazareth, the very Son of God, willingly submitted to this horrific death. Why? To answer this question, we need to go back to the beginning.
 
## Sin Separates
The Bible begins by telling us that God created the universe, and at the end of His creation, made human beings “in His own image” (Genesis 1:27). In the ancient world, kings would set up statues or likenesses of themselves to remind their subjects of their authority. The great King made human beings in His likeness to “have dominion” over the created order, to represent God’s sovereignty (Genesis 1:28).
 
But that’s not what happened. Instead of submitting to God’s authority, humanity rebelled. That act of defiance was more than a simple rules violation. It ruined a relationship. God had given Adam and Eve everything they needed in the paradise of Eden, and He dwelled with them in warm fellowship, but when Adam and Even sinned, their immediate response was to hide themselves from God’s presence. The result of this rejection of God was expulsion from His presence, eviction from the Garden of Eden.
 
The Bible calls this sentence “death.” The Lord’s warning about the forbidden fruit was that “in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die” (Genesis 2:17). One aspect of that penalty is physical death – “for you are dust, and to dust you shall return” (Genesis 3:19). And when Adam and Eve were cast from God’s presence in the Garden, they were also separated from the “tree of life,” and left to face mortality without God’s protection. But this physical aspect of death is only one piece of a much larger issue – spiritual death. Since God is the source of all life, physical and spiritual, to be driven from God is to be driven from spiritual life itself.
 
The story of Adam and Eve is the story of all of us. We all choose to do things our way rather than God’s. But what this really means is that we love something more than God. We have created a rift in that most important of all relationships, and the consequence is death.

## Love Reunites
Let’s imagine a little boy named Josh. [[2]]({{page.permalink}}/#References) He loves to play soccer, and constantly practices dribbling. His mother has a beautiful flower garden, and has told Josh that he can dribble anywhere he wants, but he must stay away from the flowers. One day though, in his imagination, Josh is about to win the World Cup, and in order to make the winning shot he tramples straight through his mother’s flowers.
 
Think of the problem Josh has created. On the surface level, he has destroyed some plants. At a deeper level, he has disobeyed his mom. Drilling down further, he has demonstrated that he loves what he wants to do more than what his mother loves. He has in fact created distance between himself and his mother, because his lack of care for his mother’s flowers really reflects a lack of regard for his mother.
 
What could make this relationship right again? What could make amends? Or, in the language of the Bible, what could provide atonement (at-one-ment) between Josh and his mom?
 
While Josh may feel bad once he realizes what he has done, and how his actions have impacted his relationship with his mom, there isn’t much a little boy could do to solve this problem on his own. If he tried to make amends by repairing the flower bed himself, it would only look worse! Nor would he have the resources to pay someone else to do it for him. What Josh needs is someone who could make things right for him. But in our little story, there is only one person with the ability and resources to make things right – the mother herself. She also possesses the greatest motive to make things right – she loves her child!
 
This is what the Bible says God has done for us in Jesus Christ. “In Christ God was reconciling the world to himself” (2 Corinthians 5:19). God took the initiative through the death of Jesus to restore our relationship with Him because He loves us (John 3:16).
 
In His perfect obedience to the Father, Jesus displayed the completely devoted love that we betray through our sinfulness. “I have kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love” (John 15:10). Jesus was perfectly “obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross” (Philippians 2:8). Jesus came to do the will of God, “and by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all” (Hebrews 10:10).
 
To go back to our little story, Josh lacked the money and capability to make things right with his mother. And in our sinfulness, we are desperately bankrupt before God. But Jesus lived a life of perfect obedience to God, utterly devoted to the Father in love. This came at great cost, however. For the mother in the story, the expenses of repairing a trampled flowerbed would be minimal. The cost of alienation from God, though, is death, and Jesus was willing to pay even that great price, to bear our penalty, so that our relationship with God could be restored. Now He invites us to accept His atoning work so that we can be reconciled to God.
 
The apostle Paul expresses the purpose of the death of Jesus like this:
 
> But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.  Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. (Romans 5:8-10)
 
## Conclusion
 
Why did Jesus die? To reconcile us to God by His perfect life and obedient death. And why was God willing to do this for us? Because He loves us. And so the answer to the question, “Why did Jesus die,” is very simple.
 
Love.
