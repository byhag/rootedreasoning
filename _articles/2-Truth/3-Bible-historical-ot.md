A Gallup poll in 2014 recorded that 21% of Americans consider the Bible to be “an ancient book of fables, legends, history, and moral precepts recorded by man.” [[1]]({{page.permalink}}/#References) Of the non-Christians that were surveyed, over 50% believe that the Bible to be “an ancient book of fables, legends, history, and moral precepts recorded by man.”
​
In the next two articles, we will be considering evidence concerning the idea that the Bible is not a book of “fables” or “legends”. Can the events written in the pages of the Bible be considered as historical fact? Beginning with the first portion of the Bible, let's examine the evidence.
​
Truth be told, archaeology cannot tell us if all the events of the Bible occurred, or if the Bible is from God. For example, artifacts from every event of the Bible can’t be recovered, and even if we held in our hands the Ten Commandments given to Moses, we could not prove that they were written by God. However, even though it cannot conclusively prove the Bible’s veracity in every instance, archaeology can provide important pieces of the past that consistently verify the Bible’s historical and factual accuracy.
 
## Bullae
A bullae is small, oval, clay stamp used to seal an official document. It usually contained the name of the person responsible for the document that was sealed, the title or office of the sealer, and/or a picture of an animal or some other artistic rendering. Hundreds of bullae have been found in sections of ancient Jerusalem. One bulla has the inscription, “Yerahme’el, son of the king.” [[2]]({{page.permalink}}/#References) Another bulla in the hoard contained the title “Elishama, servant of the king.” One of the names inscribed on a bulla was the Hebrew name “Gemaryahu the son of Shaphan.”
 
These bullae correspond remarkably to individuals identified in the Old Testament. Jerahmeel, son of king Jehoiakim, was sent to seize Baruch, the scribe, and Jeremiah, the prophet at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 B.C. ( Jeremiah 36:26). Elishama is identified as a scribe by the same prophet ( Jeremiah 36:12). Finally, Gemariah, is identified as a scribe whose chamber Baruch read the words of Jeremiah and is mentioned several times in the same book ( Jeremiah 36:10). Many more important figures can be identified from the Bible [[3]]({{page.permalink}}/#References).
 
## Hezekiah’s Siege
The Old Testament tells of a certain Judean king named Hezekiah, who defended the Judean nation from Sennacherib, the ruler of the Assyrian empire ( 2 Chronicles 32:1). In preparation for the siege on Jerusalem that was sure to occur, Hezekiah ordered to make a tunnel that redirected water from the Upper Gihon spring to inside the western wall of the city                 (2 Chronicles 32:30).
 
The tunnel itself has been maintained since its creation. In 1880, however, two boys swimming near the exit of the tunnel found an inscription containing some of the details of its construction. What is now called the Siloam inscription, says, “And this was the account of the breakthrough. While the laborers were still working with their picks, each toward the other, and while there were still three cubits to be broken through, the voice of each was heard calling to the other, because there was a crack (or split or overlap) in the rock from the south to the north. And at the moment of the breakthrough, the laborers struck each toward the other, pick against pick. Then water flowed from the spring to the pool for 1,200 cubits. And the height of the rock above the heads of the laborers was 100 cubits.” [[4]]({{page.permalink}}/#References)
 
We have other information from this same time period from the Taylor Prism, an annals of the king Sennacherib. It gives the Assyrian king’s perspective of the Israel campaign. It reads, “As to Hezekiah, the Jew, he did not submit to my yoke, I laid siege to 46 of his strong cities, walled forts and to the countless small villages in their vicinity, and conquered (them) by means of well-stamped (earth) ramps, and battering-rams brought (thus) near (to the walls) (combined with) the attack by foot soldiers, (using) mines, breeches as well as sapper work. I drove out (of them) 200,150 people, young and old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, big and small cattle beyond counting, and considered (them) booty. Himself I made a prisoner in Jerusalem, his royal residence, like a bird in a cage. I surrounded him with earthwork in order to molest those who were leaving his city’s gate” [[4]]({{page.permalink}}/#References)
 
Besides identifying Hezekiah as a historical figure, two statements of significance can be made. First, Sennacherib’s account mirrors the Biblical account of Sennacherib’s defeat of all the fortified cities of Judah (2 Chronicles 32:1). Second, even though a king would surely record if he took the capital of a nation, there is no mention of a defeat of Jerusalem, just a siege. This mirrors the Biblical text, which says that God sent an angel that slew a majority of the Assyrians, ending the siege (Isaiah 37:36).
 
## Hittites
The Old Testament, there are nearly 50 references to Hittites.They are mentioned in   Genesis 15:20 as people who inhabited the land of Canaan. 1 Kings 10:29 records that they purchased chariots and horses from King Solomon. According to the Bible, the Hittites were a powerful force in the Middle East from 1750 B.C. until 1200 B.C. But prior to the early 20th century, nothing was known of the Hittites outside the Bible, and many critics alleged that they were an invention of the biblical authors.
 
In 1906, German cuneiform expert Hugo Winckler, near Boghaz-koy, Turkey uncovered five temples, a fortified citadel, several massive sculptures, a 300 acre city, and a room full of ten thousand clay tablets [[5]]({{page.permalink}}/#References). One of these documents was a record of a treaty between the great Ramesses II and the Hittite king. Other documents showed that this newly uncovered location was the capital of the Hittite kingdom. Finally, other documents containing temples rituals resemble ceremonies performed by Jewish priests of their same time period.
 
## Conclusion
If we consider that the Bible is not a historic document, but a book full of fables and legends, then we’d be surprised to find that many characters and stories from the Bible have been discovered to have existed. However, if we consider that the Bible is a historic document, then we would not be surprised to find that these three findings (and many more, see supplementary article), and findings in the future, confirm the Biblical account.
 
The evidence points to the statement that the Old Testament is a historic document.
