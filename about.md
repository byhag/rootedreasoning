## Who are we?

We are **simply Christians.**
 
We do not belong to any organization nor are we seeking any sort of profit or recognition. Our goal is to help and strengthen others in their understanding of God's revealed wisdom.
 
Let's reason together.

## Why did we make this site?

1 Peter 3:15

“Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have.” 
 
We are neither asking nor accepting money for the expenses of this website. Everything is from our own pockets.
 
We love you, God, and His truth and simply want to share what we can with anyone we can.

## About the website

**rootedreasoning.com** is intended to be a resource for those seeking answers. We believe these answers are rooted in what God has revealed to humans through His nature and His Word. This website maps out the big questions pertaining to this hope and this life, and provides organized, succinct responses to those questions.
 
**rootedreasoning.com** provides the [TruthTree]({{site.baseurl}}/climb) in order to map out a journey through the big questions of life. We hope this website can be used as a guide and support for this journey.

## How to use the site

The TruthTree maps out a journey starting from God's existence and climbs upwards towards topics such as Jesus' resurrection. Following the TruthTree module by module, article by article, branch by branch, can help you understand the logic better and sharpen your knowledge of the truth.
 
Use it like a map! Follow it from start to finish! However, reading a map never gets you anywhere; it is the journey that you take yourself that will help you find the answers.
