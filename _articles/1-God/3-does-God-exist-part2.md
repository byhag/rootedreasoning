The first article focused on the beginning - specifically the first or “uncaused cause”. This article continues with several other lines of evidence.
 
Before we continue it is helpful to ask - what are you hoping to find?
 
You will surely find it.
 
## The evidence of design
If we took a walk together in a forest, and after a few miles came across a small uninhabited cottage, we might ask, “Whose house was this?”, “Who built this?”, or “Why did they leave?”. We automatically associate this structure with a maker that we have never seen, because we have seen the evidence of his existence. If we expand our perception to include not only the cottage, but the trees, the forest, the earth, and the universe, it also gives evidence to a much greater Maker. This evidence is seen many ways, but a few are illustrated below.
 
Many physicists and mathematicians have been puzzled by what physicist Eugene Wigner called “the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.” [[1]]({{page.permalink}}/#References) Why is it that the universe is governed by laws that follows certain rules that are predictable? Gravity, for example, behaves the same mathematical way every time. To a person who believes the universe just happened to come into being by chance, there is not reasonable explanation for this phenomenon. However, a believer in God has an answer to the perplexing reality: God designed the physical universe to be governed by fundamental laws that He had in mind.
 
In recent decades, scientists have discovered that there are many conditions of the universe and our planet that exist within a very narrow range that makes it possible to support intelligent life. Though many articles have been written on the subject of “fine-tuning”, I will point out just a few observations [[2]]({{page.permalink}}/#References). The Earth, for example, has just the right amount of gravitational pull to maintain an atmosphere fitting for life. If the Earth was larger, its atmosphere could only maintain hydrogen, like Jupiter. It it were smaller, it could not keep an atmosphere at all, like Mercury. Neither Jupiter nor Mercury can support life.
 
The hand of design is seen in many places, but it might be best seen within our own bodies. For example, the human brain is capable of simultaneously processing an amazing amount of information at once. Your brain right now is taking in colors, objects, letters (which it converts to words than ideas), temperature, the texture of the floor and keyboard, the sound of the keys on the keyboard, and even the music you might be listening to. It is said that the human brain processes more than a million messages a second and still filter what is important to your immediate attention. The eye also distinguishes between millions of messages, colors, and space while the ear hears and allows the brain to process all the sounds around us. DNA is a three-billion-lettered program that instruct each of your millions of cells. One cannot find instructions like this without a great mind behind it [[3]]({{page.permalink}}/#References).
 
## The evidence of morals
In our day to day actions, we find that there are moral objective values that impose themselves on us. For example, we all seem to understand that there are some things that are wrong, like torturing and raping, and there are seme things that are right, like helping the lost child or being honest. However, the naturalistic view which asserts that only observable things can exist, has no basis for moral values. Without a fundamental basis behind morals, morality is just the result of biological evolution or social conditioning, a result, that, according to survival of the fittest, doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. Biological evolution and social conditioning are only good answers to the question of morality when morality agrees with these sources. However, morality is at many times opposed to both evolution and social norms.
 
Alex Rosenberg, author of The Atheist’s Guide to Reality, admits, “there is no such thing as… morally right or wrong.’ He goes on to say that “Individual human life is meaningless… and without ultimate moral value.” [[4]]({{page.permalink}}/#References) What a depressing worldview. However, if there is a God, then morality is explainable.  It is grounded in His Nature - His goodness and purity. The believer in God, then has an explanation for morality while the naturalist does not.

The evidence of you, and the compelling force
Before we desire to begin bringing up counterpoints, more details, and slide into an endless circle of arguments, let me point out a very simple fact:
 
You.
 
You have read all the way to the end of this article. Why? If you have read all the way to the end of this article and do not yet believe, why do you care so much? Is it because you care so much to straighten out kind, delusional people like me? The truth is that God has created us with the intention to get to know him. Most likely, you have seen this evidence in your life. C.S. Lewis remembered, "...night after night, feeling whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work, the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. I gave in, and admitted that God was God.” God said, “Draw near to God and he will draw near to you.” ( James 4:8)
 
## Conclusion
The evidence has been laid before you. What is the best explanation for the existence of our universe? For design? For moral structure? And most importantly, for change in you?
 
We cannot prove the entire nature of God by these arguments, at least not the entire God of Christianity. His nature can only be seen through His Word, or truth. This truth is talked about more in the second branch of our truth tree, called truth. For more details on what about God can be reasoned from these preceding articles, read “What is God like? (Part 1)” for more details.
 
There is no way to prove to you that God exists. God himself wants to be accepted in faith (Hebrews 11:6). But faith is not a leap in the dark - it is a leap into the light and into a room where a large number of people await for you with open arms.
