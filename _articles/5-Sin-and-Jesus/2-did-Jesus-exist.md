If Christianity is to be supported, believed, followed, and taught, its namesake, Christ, must have truly existed. The historicity of Jesus concerns whether or not Jesus actually existed, taught, and died, as opposed to simply being a myth or legend, and examines the texts, both biblical and extrabiblical, that support that claim. Due to the fact that biblical texts clearly indicate the reality of His existence, this article will examine extrabiblical texts in connection with the historical existence of Jesus. Though other extrabiblical texts exist, a select few are included here.
 
## The Writings of Tacitus
"Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judæa, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind" [[1]]({{page.permalink}}/#References)
 
Tacitus, a first century Roman historian, demonstrated no personal bias in support of Jesus (Christus). Additionally, because of his clear bias against Jesus and the movement that came after Him, his references to the life, death, and following of Jesus can be deemed historically reliable.
 
## The Writings of Josephus
“Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the sanhedrin of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others, [or, some of his companions]; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned” [[2]]({{page.permalink}}/#References)
 
Josephus, a first century Romano-Jewish historian, makes two references to a man named Jesus in his work, Antiquities of the Jews. The reference included here not only mentions Him as a historical figure, but also acknowledges that some at the time called Him “Christ.”
 
## The Writings of Suetonius
"As the Jews were making constant disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he expelled them from Rome." [[3]]({{page.permalink}}/#References)
 
Like Tacitus, Suetonius was a first century Roman historian who portrays a bias against Christianity. Additionally, he seems to confuse the Jews and Christians, which certainly would not have been done if a Christian was responsible for the writing of this text, as some might allege.
 
## The James Ossuary
The James Ossuary is a limestone burial box with the Aramaic inscription: “James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus” inscribed in one side. Though its authenticity has been questioned, an eight year investigation involving the Israeli Antiquities Authority revealed that no evidence toward the box’s forgery was found [[4]]({{page.permalink}}/#References). For more information concerning the box, see here [[5]]({{page.permalink}}/#References).
 
Professor Camil Fuchs of Tel Aviv University, stated that of the thousands of ossuaries found from antiquity, only one has a reference to a brother. Additionally, he produced a statistical analysis of the occurrence of these three names in ancient Jerusalem and projected that there were 1.71 people named James, with a father named Joseph and a brother named Jesus, living in Jerusalem around the time at which the ossuary was produced. [[6]]({{page.permalink}}/#References) If the ossuary is authentic, it would be conclusive archaeological reference to the founder of Christianity.
 
The Writings of Lucian of Samosata
"The Christians, you know, worship a man to this day, the distinguished personage who introduced their novel rites, and was crucified on that account..." [[7]]({{page.permalink}}/#References)
 
Lucian of Samosata, a  2nd century Assyrian writer, in The Death of Peregrine, wrote about a man who took advantage of the generosity of Christians before burning himself alive. Lucian clearly displays no personal agenda in the interest of promoting promote Christianity, but rather desires to mock Christianity in his work.
 
## Conclusion
If I examine the evidence for the historical existence of Jesus just like I would examine the evidence for the existence of any historical figure, I’d find that He really did exist, even excluding ancient testimony provided by Christians. Perhaps the greatest thing to consider is that thousands, including a group of very devoted disciples, committed themselves to beliefs rooted in Jesus’ existence and died for those beliefs. People sometimes die for something they believe is true, but who would anyone die for supporting someone they know doesn’t exist?
