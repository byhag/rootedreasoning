Paul claims, “And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins” (1 Corinthians 15:17). C.S. Lewis writes, “And now, what was the purpose of it all? What did he come to do? Well, to teach, of course, but as soon as you look into the New Testament or any other Christian writing you will find that they are constantly talking about something different—about His death and His coming to life again” [[1]]({{page.permalink}}/#References).
 
Christian writers seem to see the resurrection of a Man named Jesus as the pivotal moment in history, around which the Christian movement is hinged. Why then is the rising of this Man so important? This article examines the claims Jesus made about Himself and the importance of His resurrection to the movement that followed Him.
 
## Christ’s Divinity
Jesus Himself claimed to be God. In John 10:30 He stated, “I and the Father are one”. Flavius Josephus records that, “Jesus, who was called Christ” was the brother of James [[2]]({{page.permalink}}/#References). Besides claiming that He was God, Jesus claimed that He existed before Abraham (John 8:56-58), that seeing Him was like seeing God (John 12:44-46), that He would judge all (John 5:21-23), and that He was the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6). Had He remained in the grave, His divine claims would have been shown to be false and no one could believe His testimony.
 
The fact that Jesus died on a cross does not prove that Jesus was God or was anything greater than a man. It is the fact that Jesus returned from the dead that proves He was indeed what He said He was. In death, Jesus, who claimed to be both God and man, proved that He was not contained by the laws governing human nature as He arose and thereby displayed His divine nature. It is this divine nature that gives Christ the power to save, to atone for the sins of man. This point is declared in Romans 1:4, where the apostle Paul writes of Him as the One who “was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by His resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord”.
 
## Christ’s Power Over Death
Jesus claimed that His disciples would be given eternal life, rather than death (John 10:27-28). He promised freedom from physical death. If He indeed remained in the grave, that fact alone would falsify the promises He made to those who would follow Him because it would have been made clear that He was unable to prove them true even in Himself.
 
But by rising from the dead, He proved His authority to break the bonds of death, ensuring life to those that would follow Him (Romans 6:8-9). More than just providing life and resurrection for His followers, He confirmed His claim that He was the very embodiment of the resurrection and the life (John 11:25). Christ alone transcends death and by the proof of His resurrection provides assurance that His followers will do the same.
 
## Christ’s Power Over God’s Enemy
Following Satan’s involvement in luring Adam and Eve to sin, God promised that there would be enmity between mankind and Satan, and that Satan would bruise one of Eve’s descendants, but the descendent would crush Satan’s head (Genesis 3:14-15). When Jesus came, Satan perhaps thought that he could deal a final and decisive blow in his war against God. This plan would involve persuading the same mankind that Jesus was sent to save, including one of Jesus’ closest friends, to torture and crucify Jesus.  If Jesus was not raised, then His death would have demonstrated that He was subject to Satan’s power and Satan would have won the ultimate victory.
 
But by rising from the dead, Jesus broke the power of Satan and defeated him, claiming power over him (Hebrews 2:14-15). By taking away his power, he also took away the fear of death from those that follow Him (Hebrews 2:15). Through Satan came fear and death, but through Jesus the Savior there is only victory ( 1 Corinthians 15:55-57).
 
## Conclusion
Jesus did indeed rise from the dead - this is a fact of great significance. It means not merely something, but everything. It means this Jesus was the Son of God. It means He conquered death and can provide life to those who follow Him. It means He is Lord over all, including the power of evil. It means we can live without fear through Him.
